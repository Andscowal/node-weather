# node-weather

Because who doesn't love a fun Weather App?
This was built with node and utilizes Google's Geocode API and Dark Sky's Forecast API.
It is a CLI weather app that I had a lot of fun developing!
It takes in an address of any kind, and returns that address followed by the temperature.

Enjoy!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
